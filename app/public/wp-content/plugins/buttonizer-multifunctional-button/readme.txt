= Example use cases for Buttonizer =

<strong>+ Buttonizer VS live chat alternatives</strong>. Buttonizer gives you the ability to manage different chat options at the same time in different conditions. Each visitor has a different communication need. With live chat you give the visitor only one option. When you let your visitors chat with you using chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, etc, you give them the freedom of chatting with you whenever they go. Why not get best of both worlds:

<strong>+ Launch your favorite live chat </strong>. You can use JavaScript as one of your click actions to launch other live chat products like Hubspot, Tawk.to, Tidio, Chatra, Formilla, Zoho, Zendesk, LiveChat, Crisp, Intercom and JivoChat.

<strong>+ Connect with your visitors on WhatsApp Business</strong>. Connect WhatsApp Business to your site. Your visitors can start chatting with you on WhatsApp Business.

<strong>+ Setup different floating buttons on mobile and desktop </strong>. Show different chat buttons depending on the device where your visitor is using. Like show a call now and whatsapp button on mobile and a contact form, email and url on desktop.

<strong>+ Add Click to call button</strong>. Show a phone icon and let your visitors click to call you. If you can show different local phone numbers based on page URL or available days and hours.

<strong>+ Setup two buttons on the same page with show on scroll</strong>. Impress your visitors by adding two different buttons that are visible or get hidden after a specific scroll depth. Look at the Buttonizer website as an example.

<strong>+ Show different action buttons for different pages </strong> You can use this feature to show separate widgets for different products on your website, show different buttons based on URL for WPML or multi-language sites, display different channels for your landing pages, and more.

= WHATSAPP CHAT POP UP =
You can use WhatsApp as a regular chat button, but you can also add the WhatsApp pop up and let your visitors start the conversation while the visitors are on your website. You can also easily integrate with WhatsApp Business or your regular WhatsApp account. Once the visitors click on the send button, they’ll be redirected to WhatsApp to continue the conversation there.

= Advanced JavaScript API =
Buttonizer is equipped with an advanced **Free JavaScript API** which you can use to interact with your Buttonizer menus. Trigger custom functions on particular events or just open the menu when clicking a button on your site. It's enabled instantly and can be used out of the box!

* Open menu event
* Close menu event
* Fire an action after initialization
* Fire an action after opening/closing menus
* View menu states and quick functions
* Over **6 event hooks** available
* And much more

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Floating Action Button and why should I use it? =

A floating action button is a button that 'floats' on the right corner of your website.

Maybe you noticed already that a lot of applications (mobile and web) have their primary floating action button (FAB), on the right corner of their website or app. You see this a lot with chat funtions. The Floating Action Button is becoming a standard in application and webdesign. Webvisitors are getting more and more used to the fact that there is a floating action button which is the primary action you can make on that page, on the right corner of a website.

The Buttonizer is a new way to give a boost to your number of interactions, actions and conversions from your website visitor by adding a Customizable Smart Multifunctional Floating Button in the corner of your website.

= What's the difference between floating action buttons or other conversion buttons? =

With Buttonizer you don't just add the same button to every page on your website. No, the key is that each action must be relevant. With the Buttonizer it's possible to add buttons to a select number of pages with "page rules", decide for each button if it shows on mobile and/or desktop, style your button with your own icons & colors, add social sharing buttons, Show the button on opening hours and make use of many more rules.

And the beauty of all: All actions are hidden in one button. The moment a visitor clicks on your Floating Action Button it will *pop* all specific buttons you've set for that page. Track each single button in Google Analytics so you can see which actions your visitors prefer.

In fact, Buttonizer is an addiction to use. Your website visitors will interact as never before.

= Which buttons are available with Buttonizer? =
WhatsApp chat, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Email, SMS, Snapchat, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Microsoft Teams, Vkontakte, Phone (click to call), Telegram, Line, WeChat, Viber, Waze, Google maps, Poptin, Custom URL, Page Select.

= What widgets does Buttonizer support? =

We have the following widgets natively integrated:
- WhatsApp widget
- Facebook Messenger widget
- Contact form (PRO: integrated Webhook support)
- Iframe widget (PRO)

Customize their position and visibility wherever you need. With the iframe widget you are able to show YouTube video's, integrate Calendly or any other page or website.

You can also interact with widgets using the Widget JavaScript API.

= I don’t see the button on my site, what should I do? =
Please make sure you’ve chosen at least one button and clicked on the green “Publish” button. If you still don't see any changes on the live site, you can clear the cache of your website if you have a caching plugin.

= How can I add a WhatsApp chat popup? =
Download the wordpress plugin, choose the whatsapp templates, change your phone number, change the text and there you go. You can also choose the WhatsApp widget option to add a popup window. Don’t forget to enter the WhatsApp number with country code
E.g.
country code +1
number: 6123456789
** WhatsApp number: 16123456789 **

= Can I add multiple floating action buttons with the free version? =
Yes you can. You can make unlimited amount of buttons and groups in Buttonizer.

= Does Buttonizer work on mobile? =
Yes, you can choose for each button if you want to display the button on mobile, desktop or both.

= Does Buttonizer support right-to-left languages? =
Languages can have a different direction of writing and reading? While languages such as English are written and read from left to right, other languages might follow the right-to-left style of script. Just considering the sheer number of language speakers, it is obvious that Buttonizer could not stay behind and has made sure to reserve the layout of the user interface to support right-to-left languages.

== External Services ==

To provide icon libraries and animations, Buttonizer may use the following 3rd party services for performance reasons:
* **Font Awesome** – Loads CSS and icon fonts based on the version selected by the user to display visual elements on floating buttons. Files are loaded from CDNs such as Font Awesome, Cloudflare, and BootstrapCDN. A separate account is not required to leverage either of these CDNs.
* **Buttonizer CDN (powered by Cloudflare)** – Loads CSS animations and visual effects for button hover states, entry animations, and interactive effects. A separate account is not required to leverage this CDN.
